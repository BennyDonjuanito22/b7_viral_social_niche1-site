          <p>If you believe that content on our website or distributed through our products infringes your copyright, please send a written notice to our designated agent with the following information:</p>

          </ol>
          <p>Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will forward it to the original complainant. If the complainant does not file a court action within 10 business days, we may restore the removed content.</p>
